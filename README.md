# Random_password_generated


#### ðŸ”‘ Why build another password generator?
######  Most of us create these in Java/Python/C++, but I wanted to level up:
##### ðŸ‘‰ Challenge: Turn a simple script into an interactive web app
##### ðŸ‘‰ Discovery: Streamlit â€” the Python framework that makes web development feel like coding a Jupyter notebook!

#### âœ¨ Features:

  ##### 1. Takes your nickname and name as input.

  ##### 2. Generates a username and a 10-digit random password.

  ##### 3. Automatically shows all previously generated credentials in a history panel â€” so no need to memorize those tricky passwords!
